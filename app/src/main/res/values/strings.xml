        USB Type C specifies that any USB A to C cable has a 56kOhm resistor.\n\n

        This resistor tells your phone how much voltage the cable is capable of supplying by
        default, and by reading the maximum allowed amperage of the USB chipset should allow us to
        estimate whether your cable happens to be Type-C compliant.
